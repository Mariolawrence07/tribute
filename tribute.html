    <h2>nelson mandela long walk to freedom</h2>
    <p>To Graça Machel and the Mandela family; to President Zuma and members of the government; <br> to heads of states and government, past and present, distinguished guests, <br> it is a singular honor to be with you today, to celebrate a life like no other. <br> To the people of South Africa, people of every race and walk of life <br> the world thanks you for sharing Nelson Mandela with us.
        <ul><li>His struggle was your struggle.</li> <li>His triumph was your triumph.</li> <li>Your dignity and your hope found expression in his life.</li> <li>And your freedom, your democracy is his cherished legacy.</li></ul>        

        It is hard to eulogize any man to capture in words not just the facts and the dates that make a life, <br> but the essential truth of a person their private joys and sorrows the quiet moments and unique qualities that <br> illuminate someone’s soul.  How much harder to do so for a giant of history, who moved a nation toward justice, <br> and in the process moved billions around the world.</p>
